# Changelog #

## Version 3.8.0 ##

‚ÑπÔ∏è Changes:

* `utils.gettext_helpers`:
  * `do_rescan_files`: use `--no-location` option to avoid including the file location in the translation files
  * `msgmerge`: use `--update` option to avoid regenerating the translation files
* Replace `flake8` with `ruff` for linting in GitHub Actions workflow

üõ†Ô∏è Bug fixes:

* [Issue #84](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/issues/84) - Side effects of `win32_fix_title_bar_background` with `QGraphicsEffect` active
* [Issue #82](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/issues/82) - Autodoc extension: translation of generic documentation text
  * Initially, the generic documentation text like "Returns a new instance of" was translated using the `gettext` function.
  * This was a mistake, as this text should be translated only after the documentation has been generated, i.e. by the `sphinx-intl` tool.
  * In other words, translating those generic texts should be done in the application documentation, not in the library itself.
  * To fix this issue, the generic documentation text is no longer translated using `gettext`, but is left as is in the source code.
* [Issue #80](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/issues/80) - `ValueError` when trying to show/edit an empty array

* MultipleChoiceItem: implemented `callback` property feature (was unexpectedly not supported)

üõ†Ô∏è Bug fixes:

* [Issue #78](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/issues/78) - PySide6 on Linux: `AttributeError: 'DataFrameView' object has no attribute 'MoveLeft'`
* [Issue #77](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/issues/77) - PyQt6/PySide6 on Linux: `AttributeError: type object 'PySide6.QtGui.QPalette' has no attribute 'Background'`
* Add 'Monospace' and 'Menlo' to the list of fixed-width supported fonts
* Font warning message in *configtools.py*: replace `print` by `warnings.warn`

üõ†Ô∏è Bug fixes:

* Light/dark theme support:
  * Fix default color mode issues
  * Color theme test: allow to derive from, so that the test may be completed by other widgets

## Version 3.6.1 ##

In this release, test coverage is 74%.

üõ†Ô∏è Bug fixes:

* Light/dark theme support:
  * Auto light/dark theme: quering OS setting only once, or each time the `set_color_mode('auto')` function is called
  * Fix console widget color theme: existing text in console widget was not updated when changing color theme
  * Fixed issue with dark theme on Windows: the windows title bar background was not updated when the theme was changed from dark to light (the inverse was working) - this is now fixed in `guidata.qthelpers.win32_fix_title_bar_background` function
  * Added `guidata.qthelpers.set_color_mode` function to set the color mode ('dark', 'light' or 'auto' for system default)
  * Added `guidata.qthelpers.get_color_mode` function to get the current color mode ('dark', 'light' or 'auto' for system default)
  * Added `guidata.qthelpers.get_color_theme` function to get the current color theme ('dark' or 'light')
  * Added `guidata.qthelpers.get_background_color` function to get the current background `QColor` associated with the current color theme
  * Added `guidata.qthelpers.get_foreground_color` function to get the current foreground `QColor` associated with the current color theme
  * Added `guidata.qthelpers.is_dark_theme` function to check if the current theme is dark)
  * As a consequence, `guidata.qthelpers.is_dark_mode` and `guidata.qthelpers.set_dark_mode` functions are deprecated, respectively in favor of `guidata.qthelpers.is_dark_theme` and `guidata.qthelpers.set_color_mode`

## Version 3.6.0 ##

In this release, test coverage is 74%.

üí• New features:

* Improved dark/light mode theme update:
  * The theme mode may be changed during the application lifetime
  * Added methods `update_color_mode` on `CodeEditor` and `ConsoleBaseWidget` widgets

## Version 3.5.3 ##

In this release, test coverage is 74%.

üõ†Ô∏è Bug fixes:

* Configuration initialization on Windows:
  * For various reasons, a `PermissionError` exception may be raised when trying to remove the configuration file on Windows, just after having created it for the first time. This is due to the fact that the file is still locked by the file system, even if the file has been closed. This is a known issue with Windows file system, and the solution is to wait a little bit before trying to remove the file.
  * To fix this issue, a new `try_remove_file` function has been added to the `userconfig` module, which tries multiple times to remove the file before raising an exception.

* Moved back `conftest.py` to the `tests` folder (was in the root folder), so that `pytest` can be executed with proper configuration when running the test suite from the installed package

## Version 3.5.2 ##

In this release, test coverage is 74%.

üõ†Ô∏è Bug fixes:

* Add support for NumPy 2.0:
  * Use `numpy.asarray` instead of `numpy.array(..., copy=False)`
  * Remove deprecated `numpy.core.multiarray` module import

## Version 3.5.1 ##

In this release, test coverage is 74%.

üõ†Ô∏è Bug fixes:

* [PR #74](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/pull/74) - `configtools.font_is_installed`: fix PySide2 compat. issue (thanks to @xiaodaxia-2008)
* Creating a dataset using the `create` class method:
  * Before, passing unknown keyword arguments failed silently (e.g. `MyParameters.create(unknown=42)`).
  * Now, an `AttributeError` exception is raised when passing unknown keyword arguments, as expected.
* Processing Qt event loop in unattended mode before closing widgets and quitting the
  application, so that all pending events are processed before quitting: this includes
  for instance the drawing events of widgets, which may be necessary to avoid a crash
  when closing the application (e.g. if drawing the widget is required for some
  reason before closing it) or at least to ensure that test coverage includes all
  possible code paths.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Other changes:

* Preparing for NumPy V2 compatibility: this is a work in progress, as NumPy V2 is not
  yet released. In the meantime, requirements have been updated to exclude NumPy V2.
* Internal package reorganization: moved icons to `guidata/data/icons` folder
* The `delay` command line option for environment execution object `execenv` is now
  expressed in milliseconds (before it was in seconds), for practical reasons
* Explicitely exclude NumPy V2 from the dependencies (not compatible yet)

## Version 3.5.0 ##

In this release, test coverage is 74%.

üí• New features:

* New Sphinx autodoc extension:
  * Allows to document dataset classes and functions using Sphinx directives, thus generating a comprehensive documentation for datasets with labels, descriptions, default values, etc.
  * The extension is available in the `guidata.dataset.autodoc` module
  * Directives:
    * `autodataset`: document a dataset class
    * `autodataset_create`: document a dataset creation function
    * `datasetnote`: add a note explaining how to use a dataset
* `BoolItem`/`TextItem`: add support for callbacks when the item value changes

üõ†Ô∏è Bug fixes:

* Documentation generation: automatic requirement table generation feature was failing
  when using version conditions in the `pyproject.toml` file (e.g. `pyqt5 >= 5.15`).
* [Issue #72](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/issues/72) - unit test leave files during the build usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/test.json
* [Issue #73](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/issues/73) - `ChoiceItem` radio buttons are duplicated when using callbacks

## Version 3.4.1 ##

In this release, test coverage is 76%.

üõ†Ô∏è Bug fixes:

* [Issue #71](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/issues/71) - Random segmentation faults with applications embedding `CodeEditor`
* [Issue #70](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/issues/70) - PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/guidata/tests/data/genreqs/requirements.rst'

## Version 3.4.0 ##

In this release, test coverage is 76%.

üí• New features:

* `dataset.io.h5fmt.HDF5Reader.read` method: added new `default` argument to set
    default value for missing data in the HDF5 file (backward compatible). The default
    value of `default` is `NoDefault` (a special value to indicate that no default value
    should be used, and that an exception should be raised if the data is missing).
* `widgets.codeeditor.CodeEditor`: added new `inactivity_timeout` argument to set
    the time (in milliseconds) to wait after the user has stopped typing before
    emitting the `CodeEditor.SIG_EDIT_STOPPED` signal.
* Added `execenv.accept_dialogs` attribute to control whether dialogs should be
    automatically accepted or not (default is `None`, meaning no automatic acceptance):
    this allows more coverage of the test suite. For now, this attribute has only been
    proven useful in `tests/dataset/test_all_features.py`.
* Added unit tests for HDF5 and JSON serialization/deserialization:
  * Testing an arbitrary data model saved/loaded to/from HDF5 and JSON files,
      with various data sets and other data types.
  * Testing for backward compatibility with previous versions of the data model
      (e.g. new attributes, removed attributes, etc.)

‚ö†Ô∏è API breaking changes:

* `guidata.dataset.io` module is now deprecated and will be removed in a future
    release. Please use `guidata.io` instead. This change is backward compatible
    (the old module is still available and will be removed in a future release).
    The motivation for this change is to simplify the module structure and to help
    understand that the scope of the `io` module is not limited to `dataset.DataSet`
    objects, but may be used for any kind of data serialization/deserialization.

üìñ Documentation:

* Added missing `DataSetEditDialog` and `DataSetEditLayout` classes
* Added missing inheritance/member details on some classes
* Reduced table of contents depth in left sidebar for better readability

## Version 3.3.0 ##

In this release, test coverage is 72%.

üí• New features:

* Array editor now supports row/column insertion/deletion:
  * Added `variable_size` argument to `setup_and_check` method
  * The feature is disabled by default (backward compatible)
  * It supports standard arrays, masked arrays, record arrays and N-dimensional arrays
* New dataset read-only mode:
  * Added `readonly` argument to `DataSet` constructor
  * This is useful to create a dataset that will be displayed in read-only mode
      (e.g. string editing widgets will be in read-only mode: text will be selectable
      but not editable)
  * The items remain modifiable programmatically (e.g. `dataset.item = 42`)
* New dataset group edit mode:
  * Added `mode` argument to `DataSetGroup.edit` method, with the following options:
    * `mode='tabs'` (default): each dataset is displayed in a separate tab
    * `mode='table'`: all datasets are displayed in a single table
  * In the new table mode, the datasets are displayed in a single table with
      one row per dataset and one column per item
  * Clicking on a row will display the corresponding dataset in a modal dialog box

üõ†Ô∏è Bug fixes:

* Qt console:
  * Fixed `RuntimeError: wrapped C/C++ object of type DockableConsole has been deleted`
    when closing the console widget (parent widget, e.g. a `QMainWindow`, was deleted)
    while an output stream is still writing to the console (e.g. a `logging` handler
    which will flush the output stream when closing the application)
  * This concerns all console-related widgets: `DockableConsole`, `Console`,
    `InternalShell`, `PythonShellWidget` and `ShellBaseWidget`
* Code editor: fixed compatibility issue with PySide6
  (`AttributeError: 'QFont' object has no attribute 'Bold'`)

## Version 3.2.2 ##

üõ†Ô∏è Bug fixes:

* Fixed translation support (`gettext`):
  * Locale detection has been fixed in 3.1.1 (deprecation of `locale.getdefaultlocale`)
  * However, on frozen distributions on Windows (e.g. with `pyinstaller`), function
    `locale.getlocale` is returning `(None, None)` instead of proper locale infos
  * Added a workaround: on Windows, if locale can't be detected, we now use the
    Windows API to retrieve it (using the `GetUserDefaultLocaleName` function)
  * [Issue #68](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/issues/68) - Windows: gettext translation is not working on frozen applications
* Embedded Qt console:
  * Fixed default encoding detection on frozen applications on Windows
  * [Issue #69](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/issues/69) - Windows/Qt console: output encoding is not detected on frozen applications

## Version 3.2.1 ##

üõ†Ô∏è Bug fixes:

* Tests only: `qthelpers.close_widgets_and_quit` now ignores deleted widgets

üí• Changes:

* `dataset.ImageChoiceItem` and `dataset.ButtonItem`: added `size` argument to set the icon size
* `dataset.io` reader and writer classes: removed deprecated `write_unicode` method

## Version 3.2.0 ##

üõ†Ô∏è Bug fixes:

* [Issue #67](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/issues/67) - JSONReader/Deserializing object list: TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable

üí• Changes:

* `qthelpers.qt_wait`: added `show_message` and `parent` arguments (backward compatible)
* `qthelpers.qt_app_context`: removed `faulthandler` support (this need to be handled at the application level, see for example [DataLab's implementation](https://github.com/Codra-Ingenierie-Informatique/DataLab/blob/2a7e95477a8dfd827b037b39ef5e045309760dc8/cdlapp/utils/qthelpers.py#L87))
* Disabled command line argument parsing in `guidata.env` module:
  * The `guidata` library is parsing command line arguments for the purpose of creating the environment execution object named `execenv` (see `guidata.env` module). This object is used to determine the execution environment mainly for testing purposes: for example, to bypass the Qt event loop when running tests thanks to the `--unattended` command line option.
  * However this argument parsing is not always desirable, for example when using `guidata` as a dependency in another library or application. This is why the parsing mechanism is now disabled by default, and may be enabled by setting the environment variable `GUIDATA_PARSE_ARGS` to `1` (or any other non-empty value). As of today, it is still unclear if there will be a need to enable this mechanism in the future, so this is why the environment variable is used instead of a function argument.
* Removed deprecated `guidata.disthelpers` module (we recommend using [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) instead)

## Version 3.1.1 ##

üõ†Ô∏è Bug fixes:

* 'Apply' button state is now correctly updated when modifying one of the following items:
  * `dataset.MultipleChoiceItem`
  * `dataset.dataitems.DictItem`
  * `dataset.dataitems.FloatArrayItem`
* Fixed minor deprecation and other issues related to locale

üí• Changes:

* Removed `--unattended` command line option for `pytest`:
  * Before: `pytest --unattended guidata` (to run tests without Qt event loop)
  * Now: `pytest guidata` (there is no use case for running tests with Qt event loop,
    so the `--unattended` option was removed and the *unattended* mode is now the default)
* Removed CHM documentation (obsolete format)

## Version 3.1.0 ##

‚ö† Exceptionally, this release contains the following API breaking changes:

* Moved `utils.update_dataset` to `dataset.conv.update_dataset`
* Moved `utils.restore_dataset` to `dataset.conv.restore_dataset`

‚úî API simplification (backward compatible):

* Dataset items may now be imported from `guidata.dataset` instead of `guidata.dataset.dataitems`
* Dataset types may now be imported from `guidata.dataset` instead of `guidata.dataset.datatypes`
* Examples:
  * `from guidata.dataset.dataitems import FloatItem` becomes `from guidata.dataset import FloatItem`
  * `from guidata.dataset.datatypes import DataSet` becomes `from guidata.dataset import DataSet`
  * Or you may now write:

    ```python
    import guidata.dataset as gds

    class MyParameters(gds.DataSet):
        """My parameters"""
        freq = gds.FloatItem("Frequency", default=1.0, min=0.0, nonzero=True)
        amp = gds.FloatItem("Amplitude", default=1.0, min=0.0)
    ```

üí• New features:

* New `dataset.create_dataset_from_dict`: create a dataset from a dictionary,
  using keys and values to create the dataset items
* New `dataset.create_dataset_from_func`: create a dataset from a function signature,
  using type annotations and default values to create the dataset items
* `dataset.dataitems.StringItem`:
  * Added argument `password` to hide text (useful for passwords)
  * Added argument `regexp` to validate text using a regular expression
* `dataset.dataitems.FileSaveItem`, `dataset.dataitems.FileOpenItem`,
  `dataset.dataitems.FilesOpenItem` and `dataset.dataitems.DirectoryItem`:
  added argument `regexp` to validate file/dir name using a regular expression
* `dataset.dataitems.DictItem`: added support for HDF5 and JSON serialization
* `dataset.io.h5fmt` and `dataset.io.jsonfmt`: added support for lists and dictionnaries serialization

‚ôª New PlotPyStack internal features:

* `widgets.about`: handle about dialog box informations (Python, Qt, Qt bindings, ...)
* Renamed development environment variable `GUIDATA_PYTHONEXE` to `PPSTACK_PYTHONEXE`

üßπ Bug fixes:

* Fixed Qt6 compatibility issue with `QFontDatabase`

## Version 3.0.6 ##

Bug fixes:

* `widgets.console.interpreter`: replaced threading.Thread.isAlive (deprecated since Python 3.8)

Other changes:

* `DataSet.edit`, `DataSet.view` and `DataSetGroup.edit`: added missing arguments `size` and `wordwrap`
* Documentation: added check-list before submitting a patch (see [`contribute.rst`](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/blob/master/doc/dev/contribute.rst) file)
* Fixed some typing annotations and docstrings, as well as Pylint false positives
* Removed unused functions from `guidata.utils.encoding` module:
  * `transcode`
  * `getfilesystemencoding`
* Added missing docstrings and typing annotations in modules:
  * `guidata.dataset.qtitemwidgets`
  * `guidata.dataset.qtwidgets`
  * `guidata.utils.encoding`
  * `guidata.utils.misc`

## Version 3.0.5 ##

Bug fixes:

* [Issue #65](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/issues/65) - QVariant import erroneously used in typing annotations

Other changes:

* `tests.test_callbacks`: added an example of a callback function for dynamically
  changing the list of choices of a `ChoiceItem` object

## Version 3.0.4 ##

Bug fixes:

* [Issue #63](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/issues/63) - [3.0.2] there is no more guidata-test script

* [Issue #62](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/issues/62) - [3.0.2] sphinx doc hang when building on the Debian infra

Other changes:

* [Issue #64](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/issues/64) - Add guidata-tests.desktop file to repository

## Version 3.0.3 ##

Fixed project description:

* This could be seen as a detail, but as this description text is used by PyPI,
  it is important to have a correct description.

* Of course, nobody reads the description text, so it was not noticed since the
  first release of guidata v3.0.

## Version 3.0.2 ##

Bug fixes:

* [Pull Request #61](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/pull/61) - Make the build reproducible, by [@lamby](https://github.com/lamby)

* [Issue #59](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/issues/59) - [3.0.1] the doc is missing

* [Issue #60](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/issues/60) - [3.0.1] pyproject.toml/setuptools: automatic package discovery does not work on debian

## Version 3.0.1 ##

API changes (fixes inconsistencies in API):

* Moved `guidata.dataset.iniio.WriterMixin` to `guidata.dataset.io.WriterMixin`
* Moved `guidata.dataset.iniio.BaseIOHandler` to `guidata.dataset.io.BaseIOHandler`
* Moved `guidata.dataset.iniio` to `guidata.dataset.io.inifmt` and renamed:

  * `UserConfigWriter` to `INIWriter`
  * `UserConfigReader` to `INIReader`
* Moved `guidata.dataset.jsonio` to `guidata.dataset.io.jsonfmt`
* Moved `guidata.dataset.hdf5io` to `guidata.dataset.io.h5fmt`

Bug fixes:

* [Issue #57](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/issues/57) - [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'doc/dev/v2_to_v3.csv'

* [Issue #58](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/issues/58) - Test suite: missing dependencies (pandas, Pillow)

* Modules `guidata.dataset.datatypes` and `guidata.dataset.dataitems` should not
  critically depend on Qt (only modules specific to GUI should depend on Qt, such
  as `guidata.dataset.qtwidgets`). This was a regression introduced in version 3.0.0.
  A new unit test was added to prevent this kind of regression in the future.

* Fixed documentation generation `.readthedocs.yaml` file (Qt 5.15 was not
  installed on ReadTheDocs servers, causing documentation build to fail)

Other changes:

* [Pull Request #55](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata/pull/55) - DateItem and DateTimeItem: added 'format' parameter for formatting, by [@robochat](https://github.com/robochat)

* Packaging: still using `setuptools`, switched from `setup.cfg` to `pyproject.toml`
  for configuration (see [PEP 517](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/))

## Version 3.0.0 ##

New major release:

* New BSD 3-Clause License

* New automated test suite:
  * Added module `guidata.env` to handle execution environment
  * Added support for an "unattended" execution mode (Qt loop is bypassed)
  * Added support for pytest fixtures
  * Added support for coverage testing: 70% coverage to date
* Documentation was entirely rewritten using Sphinx
* Reorganized modules:
  * Moved `guidata.hd5io` to `guidata.dataset.hdf5io`
  * Moved `guidata.jsonio` to `guidata.dataset.jsonio`
  * Renamed `guidata.userconfigio` to `guidata.dataset.iniio`
  * New package `guidata.utils` for utility functions:
    * Removed deprecated or unused functions in old `guidata.utils` module
    * Moved old `guidata.utils` module to `guidata.utils.misc`, except the
      functions `update_dataset` and `restore_dataset` which are still in
      `guidata.utils` (root module)
    * Moved `guidata.encoding` to `guidata.utils.encoding`
    * Moved `guidata.gettext_helpers` to `guidata.utils.gettext_helpers`
  * Splitted `guidata.qtwidgets` in two modules:
    * `guidata.widgets.dockable` for dockable widgets
    * `guidata.widgets.rotatedlabel` for rotated label
* Other changes:
  * `guidata.guitest`:
    * Added support for subpackages
    * New comment directive (`# guitest: show`) to add test module to test suite or
      to show test module in test launcher (this replaces the old `SHOW = True` line)
  * `guidata.dataset.datatypes.DataSet`: new `create` class method for concise
    dataset creation, allowing to create a dataset with a single line of code by
    passing default item values as keyword arguments

* Added CHM documentation to wheel package
* hdf5io: added support for a progress bar callback in "read_object_list" (this allows implementing a progress dialog widget showing the progress when reading an object list in an HDF5 file)

Bug fixes:

* Python 3 compatibility: fixed `hdf5io.HDF5Writer.write_object_list` method
* data items:
  * StringItem: when `notempty` parameter was set to True, item value was not checked at startup (expected orange background)
* disthelpers:
  * Supporting recent versions of SciPy, h5py and IPython
  * Fixed compatibility issue (workaround) with IPython on Python 2.7 (that is the "collection.sys cx_Freeze error")

### Version 1.7.2 ###

Bug fixes:

* Fixed compatibility issues with old versions of Spyder (<v2.3)

### Version 1.7.1 ###

Bug fixes:

* Fixed Issue #25: ConfigParser.get unexpected keyword argument 'raw'
* Fixed tests failures: disthelpers, guiqwt/tests/loadsaveitems_hdf5.py

Features:

* userconfigio: added support for serializing/deserializing NumPy scalars
* Fixed Issue #47: added support for DateTimeItem/DateItem (de)serialization

Setup:

* Using setuptools "entry_points" instead of distutils "scripts"

### Version 1.7.0 ###

Possible API compatibility issues:

* Added support for PyQt5 (removed old-style signals)

### Version 1.6.1 ###

Possible API compatibility issues:

* disthelpers:
  * Changed arguments from "architecture=None, python_version=None" to "msvc_version, architecture=None"

### Version 1.6.0 ###

Added support for Python 3 (see module `guidata.py3compat`).

New features:

* disthelpers:
  * Added support for Python 3.3
  * Added support for pygments (and partial support for zmq: still failing)
* FloatArrayItem: added support for `unit` property value

Bug fixes:

* disthelpers.prepend_module_to_path: unload modules which were already imported to be able to replace them by other versions (mostly `guidata` should be concerned by this if the function is used -as it should be- in package's __init__.py script)

### Version 1.5.1 ###

New features:

* HDF5 serialization (HDF5 reader/writer):
  * Added context manager
  * Added convenience methods `read` and `write`
  * Added convenience methods `write_object_list` and `read_object_list` to save/restore objects implementing DataSet-like `serialize` and `deserialize` methods
* Datasets I/O (HDF5/ini): None values (unset items) can now be saved/loaded for FloatItem, IntItem and BoolItem objects
* disthelpers: added option 'exclude_dirs' to 'add_module_data_files' and 'add_module_data_dir' methods
* Added slider support for FloatItem objects (contributor: julien.jaeck)
* (Issue 21) Added option 'size' in dataset `edit` and `view` methods to resize the generated dialog box (size may be a tuple of integers (width, height) or a QSize object)

Possible API compatibility issues:

* guidata now requires Python 2.6 (Python 2.5 support has been dropped)

Bug fixes:

* DataSet objects (de)serialization: fixed HDF5 reader/writer for FilesOpenItem and FloatArrayItem serialize/deserialize methods
* Fixed DataSet userconfig read/write test
* StringItem/ColorItem: fixed unicode/str issues in deserialization methods
* Added support for strings encoded in file system charset to avoid an error like "String %r is not UTF-8 encoded" when trying to set an item to a string value (path) obtained with a file system command
* configtools/image paths: handling file system encoded paths
* (Issue 14) Restored compatiblity with PyQt v4.4

### Version 1.5.0 ###

Bug fixes:

* Fixed 'callback' property related issue: when updating a DataSetShowGroupBox or
DataSetEditGroupBox internal dataset, the callback property was causing a reset
of the data items to their default values

Possible API compatibility issues:

* datatypes.OperatorProperty was renamed to FuncProp

Other changes:

* Added test for the FuncProp item property: how to change an item active state depending on another item's value
* Added support for dictionaries for `update_dataset` and `restore_dataset` (functions of `guidata.utils`):
  * `update_dataset` may update the destination dataset from a source dictionary
  * `restore_dataset` may update the destination dictionary from a source dataset
* FloatArrayItem: added option "large" to show all the array values in read-only mode
* Added new guidata svg logo
* disthelpers:
  * added support for PySide
    * disthelpers: new function 'get_visual_studio_dlls' -- returns the list of Visual
Studio DLLs (and create manifest) associated to Python architecture and version

### Version 1.4.2 ###

Bug fixes:

* disthelpers:
  * the vs2008 option was accidently turned off by default on Windows platforms
  * build_chm.bat: added support for Windows x64

Other changes:

* dataset.qtwidgets:
  * QLabel widgets word wrapping is now disabled for read-only items and may be disabled for dataset comments: this is necessary because when the parent widget height is constrained, Qt is unexpectedly reducing the height of word-wrapped QLabel widgets below their minimum size, hence truncating their contents...
* disthelpers:
  * raising an exception when the right version of Ms Visual C++ DLLs was not found
  * now creating the manifest and distributing from the redistribuable package installed in WinSxS

### Version 1.4.1 ###

Bug fixes:

* ColorItem for recent versions of Qt: in QLineEdit widget, the text representation of color was str(QColor(...)) instead of str(QColor(...).name())
* guidata.qt compat package: fixed _modname typo
* hdf5io:
  * optional attribute mechanism generalized to both Attr and DSet objects (for both saving and loading data)
  * H5Store/`close` method: now checking if h5 file has already been closed before trying to close it (see <http://code.google.com/p/h5py/issues/detail?id=220>)
* disthelpers:
  * vs2008 option was ignored
  * added 'C:\Program Files (x86)' to bin includes (cx_Freeze)
* Data items/callbacks: fixed callbacks for ChoiceItem (or derived items) which were triggered when other widgets were triggering their own callbacks...

Other changes:

* Added test for item callbacks
* dataset.datatypes.FormatProp/new behavior: added `ignore_error` argument, default to True (ignores string formatting error: ValueError)
* disthelpers:
  * Distribution.Setup: added `target_dir` option
  * Distribution.build: added `create_archive` option to create a ZIP archive after building the package
  * cx_Freeze: added support for multiple executables
  * added support for h5py 2.0
  * added support for Maplotlib 1.1
* Allow DateTime edit widgets to popup calendar

### Version 1.4.0 ###

Possible API compatibility issues:

* disthelpers: removed functions remove_build_dist, add_module_data_files,
    add_text_data_file, get_default_excludes, get_default_includes,
    get_default_dll_excludes, create_vs2008_data_files (...) which were
    replaced by a class named Distribution,
    see the new disthelpers test for more details (tests/dishelpers.py)
* reorganized utils and configtools modules

Other changes:

* disthelpers: replaced almost all functions by a class named Distribution,
    and added support for cx_Freeze (module remains compatible with py2exe),
    see the new disthelpers test for more details (tests/dishelpers.py)
* reorganized utils and configtools modules

### Version 1.3.2 ###

Since this version, `guidata` is compatible with PyQt4 API #1 *and* API #2.
Please read carefully the coding guidelines which have been recently added to
the documentation.

* Improved dataset __str__ method: code refactoring with read-only dataset widgets (DataItem: added methods 'format_string' and 'get_string_value', DataSet: added method 'to_string')
* Added coding guidelines to the documentation
* guidata.dataset.qtwidget: added specific widget (ShowBooleanWidget) for read-only display of bool items (text is striked out when value is False)
* guidata.hdf5io.Dset: added missing keyword argument 'optional' (same effect as parent class Attr)
* guidata.dataset.dataitems.IntItem objects: added support for sliders (fixes Issue 9) with option slider=True (see documentation)

### Version 1.3.1 ###

Bug fixes:
