Since this version, `guidata` is compatible with !PyQt4 API #1 *and* API #2.
Please read carefully the coding guidelines which have been recently added to 
the documentation.

  * Array editor: added option to set row/col labels (resp. ylabels and xlabels)
  * !ButtonItem: changed callback arguments to  *instance* (!DataSet object), *value* (item value), *parent* (button's parent widget)
